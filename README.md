# Web Interface for Supervising and Interacting with a Fleet of Mobile Robots

This repository hosts a web interface and database setup designed for the user study detailed in the publication titled:

"[On the Impact of Interruptions During Multi-Robot Supervision Tasks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10160323)," presented at the 2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) in London, United Kingdom (pp. 9771-9777, doi: 10.1109/ICRA48891.2023.10160323).

To deploy, you can locally host the database using XAMPP or similar software. The interface is optimized for any modern desktop or laptop browser. Please note that the code's integrity has not been verified for mobile phone screens.
